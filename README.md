# codaTS syntax theme

### Description
This is an light syntax theme based on the coda theme, which is tuned to make coding easier, more efficient and less tiring.
I use this theme at my work, and I prefer a light theme any time over a dark theme.
It's toned down from to a gray background to make it less strenuous to look at over the whole workday.
