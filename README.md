# codaTS syntax theme

### Description
This is an light syntax theme based on the coda theme, which is tuned to make coding easier, more efficient and less tiring.
I use this theme at my work, and I prefer a light theme any time over a dark theme.
It's toned down from to a gray background to make it less strenuous to look at over the whole workday.

### Light themes better for your eyes!
Personally I feel strongly dark text on a white background is so much easier to scan and read, especially code.
Research seems to show this as well:
- http://uxmovement.com/content/when-to-use-white-text-on-a-dark-background/
- http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/53264/dark-or-white-color-theme-is-better-for-the-eyes

So this is a theme for all coders among us who work in a normal office and not their dark basement.
